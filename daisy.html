                    <p>
                        Daisy 7094 is an interactive art installation that turns the participants’ conversations into
                        geometric artworks that can then be played back in real time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Daisy 7094 was created for my Interactive Arts class in the winter of 2022.

                    <h2>Ideation Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        When we were first assigned the task to create an interactive art piece, I wanted participants
                        to be able to walk away from our installation with a customized piece of artwork.
                        After a few more ideation sessions with my group, I came up with the initial idea
                        for Daisy 7094, which was to record a conversation between two random participants and then
                        paint
                        on a canvas using the sound data that we grabbed from microphones.

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        My original idea for the final output was to create an image that was generated based on the
                        voice data of the participants. However, this version of the output ended up looking too generic
                        and the uniqueness of each participant was not being captured. After getting some advice from my
                        professor I realized that the participants should be able to “read” the final output to an
                        extent. If they did not know what the final image represented, then the artwork would lose
                        meaning.

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>
                        The biggest challenge I faced while working on this project was trying to let the participants
                        distinguish themselves. At first, I tried only using colour to distinguish between participants
                        but that felt a bit too arbitrary. So, I thought about the vocal aspects that distinguished
                        people in a conversation. The main aspects I came up with are their tone of voice while
                        speaking, how loud they were speaking and when they chose not to speak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With these three aspects as well as letting the participants choose a color that they felt
                        represented them, I could create a connection between the participants and the artwork. When the
                        participants watched the final output, they would be able to recall some aspects of the
                        conversation based on just the visual representation.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Daisy 7094 had a very positive reception during the day of the showcase. So much so that we also
                        presented at the 2023 FCAT Undergraduate Conference. Through working on this project, I was able
                        to practice my skills in ideation and design. Most importantly, I was able to develop my
                        cooperation and communication skills.
