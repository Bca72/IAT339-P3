                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I was tasked with designing and building a 3D model of a park pavilion using
                        the software Rhino3D.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pavilion was created for my Spatial Design class in the Spring of 2023.

                <div class="project-block-text">
                    <h2>Ideation Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the initial design of the pavilion each person in my group created a rough sketch. We
                        realized that all of us had a similar cylindrical design in mind, so we picked aspects that we
                        liked about each one and worked it into the final model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the pavilion will be used for music recitals and performances. I chose a location a bit
                        north of the central pathway for its accessibility and greenery. The central pathways of the
                        park are connected to the parkâ€™s entrances and exits which means that the pavilion will be
                        visible to the many park visitors walking by. The abundance of trees in the area also provides a
                        scenic backdrop and some shade for hot summer days.

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        When designing the rhino model, I went through several different iterations. I experimented with
                        different styles of entrances, walls, and roofs. For example, in some iterations the entrance
                        was tentlike while others were arched. The roof also experienced a lot of change. Initially I
                        was going to make the roof domed. But, after receiving feedback I decided to design an open the
                        roof. This not only allowed more natural light into the pavilion but, it also made the design
                        more unique.

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main challenge that I faced while creating the pavilion was building the model itself. This
                        is because it was the first time that I had used Rhino, so I had to learn the program from
                        scratch. I believe that my experience in coding had helped me here. This is because when I am
                        coding, I often find myself looking up answers online whenever I am confused. From these
                        experiences I have developed good self-directed learning skills. These skills allowed me to
                        easily learn how to use Rhino.

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>
                        After submitting the project, I realized that I had made some mistakes when designing the model
                        in Rhino. When modeling in Rhino human scale was hard to account for. So, although the pavilion
                        looked good it would not be functional. This is because the entrance and railings were too
                        short. If I were to do this project again, before creating the model I would first look up the
                        standard measurement for human affordances and then design the model using these measurements as
                        a basis.
